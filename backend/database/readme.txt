before try to use the functions in 
you should look at how I defined the model in database/model, also the source code in student.js / tutor.js/ user.js, it have a brief description

also, test cases are also included, you should see what is working and what is not

install all dependencies when you are in the backend folder and installed MongoDB if you haven't, 
then you can run the testcases by "npm run test-db-all"
